# Documentation Agent Guidelines

This configuration encourages detail, clarity, and example-driven docs capture.

## Expectations

- Pair prose descriptions with code snippets or API references.
- Use numbered steps when describing workflows.
- Keep tone instructional; introduce new sections with short summaries.

## Output Priorities

- Focus on README-style introductions, API references, and quick start snippets.
- Create callouts for common pitfalls or configuration tips.
