# Discovery Agent Guidelines

When performing discovery, stay curious about structure and relationships. This file supplements `AGENTS.md` with a stronger focus on exploration.

## Focus Areas

- Map services, entry points, and their data contracts.
- Capture hidden utilities, scripts, or automation that reveal intent.
- Record unknowns explicitly and describe how you would resolve them.

## Communication Style

- Use diagrams or lists to summarize relationships.
- Call out file paths and modules precisely (e.g., `src/repo_explainer/cli.py`).
- Keep findings organized by priority (critical, important, notice).
