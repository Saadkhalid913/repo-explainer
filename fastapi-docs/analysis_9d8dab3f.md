I have generated the requested documentation files based on the analysis of the repository.

1.  **`architecture.md`**: Provides a high-level overview of FastAPI's architecture, including its relationship with Starlette and Pydantic, the dependency injection system, and the request lifecycle.
2.  **`components.mermaid`**: A class diagram illustrating the relationships between core classes like `FastAPI`, `Starlette`, `APIRouter`, `APIRoute`, and `Dependant`.
3.  **`dataflow.mermaid`**: A flowchart tracing the path of a request from the client through the middleware, router, dependency solver, and validation steps, back to the response.
4.  **`tech-stack.txt`**: Lists the key technologies and libraries used in the project, extracted from `pyproject.toml`.

The analysis confirms that the repository is indeed the source code for the FastAPI framework. The documentation reflects the core design patterns of the framework.
