# Claude Agent Guidelines

This file mirrors `.claude.md` but is packaged with the agent code so wrappers can seed repositories with consistent instructions.

## Approach

- Be descriptive and precise — mention code paths and APIs you inspect.
- Capture both high-level architecture and low-level details when relevant.
- Flag gaps in documentation or configuration.

## Communication

- When issuing recommendations, pair them with a rationale and action item.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity when enumerating findings.
