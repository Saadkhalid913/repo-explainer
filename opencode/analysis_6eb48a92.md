I'll analyze this repository and generate comprehensive documentation. Let me start by exploring the codebase structure and understanding the components.


Now I'll generate the comprehensive documentation based on this analysis.





I've successfully generated comprehensive documentation for the OpenCode repository:

## Generated Files:

1. **`architecture.md`** - High-level architecture overview covering:
   - System purpose and client/server model
   - Agent system architecture and security
   - Component responsibilities and relationships
   - Technology stack and deployment patterns
   - Key architectural strengths

2. **`components.mermaid`** - Mermaid diagram showing:
   - User interfaces (TUI, Web, Desktop, SDK)
   - Core server and agent system
   - AI providers and tool registry
   - File system, Git, and LSP integration
   - Cloud services and infrastructure

3. **`dataflow.mermaid`** - Mermaid diagram illustrating:
   - User input processing pipeline
   - Agent execution flow
   - Tool execution and result aggregation
   - Real-time streaming via SSE
   - Session persistence and collaboration

4. **`tech-stack.txt`** - Comprehensive technology listing including:
   - Core runtime (Bun, TypeScript)
   - Frontend frameworks (SolidJS, Tauri)
   - Backend technologies (Hono, SST)
   - AI providers and integration
   - Development tools and deployment platforms

The documentation reveals OpenCode as a sophisticated AI coding assistant with a multi-agent architecture, provider-agnostic AI integration, and support for multiple client interfaces (terminal, web, desktop) all powered by a robust TypeScript/Bun backend.
