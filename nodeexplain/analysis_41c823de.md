I have analyzed the repository, which is the **Node.js** source code. Based on the analysis, I have generated the following documentation:

1.  **`architecture.md`**: Provides a high-level overview of the Node.js architecture, detailing the interaction between the JavaScript standard library, C++ bindings, V8 engine, and libuv.
2.  **`components.mermaid`**: A visual diagram mapping the relationships between the user application, Node.js API, bindings, and core dependencies like V8 and libuv.
3.  **`dataflow.mermaid`**: A sequence diagram illustrating the data flow of an asynchronous operation through the Node.js Event Loop.
4.  **`tech-stack.txt`**: A comprehensive list of the languages (JavaScript, C++, Python), core libraries (V8, libuv, OpenSSL), and build tools used in the project.

These files are now available in the current directory.
